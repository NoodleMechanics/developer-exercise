Take return statement inside App.js (the HTML that is returned) and create a reusable componet with it. 
Also take render function and abstract it to allow the information to be sent to it, and then it grabs the information from the various different files and returns.
Run the calculations inside the return statement using Rest Route (server side). 

Take seed data and allow for input from file.

Make it so you can input one time, monthly, variable term, or both for input of revenue or expense.

It would be better to break this main app componet into multiple components allowing for separat, reusable, componets.
